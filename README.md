Amphora is not affiliated with or endorsed by Pandora Media, Inc.

Amphora uses a [3rd party node module](https://github.com/FireController1847/Pandora.js#-usage-conditions) called Pandora.js in order to authenticate to Pandora. Pandora.js is not responsible for any legal repercussions from using Amphora; including but not limited to what is stated on it's site: 

> Pandora does not endorse the usage of this API, and it may even get your account banned. If you use this API to pirate songs or play songs without playing the additional ads for them, you are doing so at your own risk. This API is merely to provide a way to use Pandora in Node.js. What you do with it is on you. If Pandora Media comes after you, sues you, or anything similar because your app is breaking the terms of service (or anything similar), you CANNOT blame this API. You must ALWAYS play ads on a non-premium user account!
